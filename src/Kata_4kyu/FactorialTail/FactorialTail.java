/**
 * Factorial tail
 *
 * The problem
 *
 * How many zeroes are at the end of the factorial of 10? 10! = 3628800, i.e. there are 2 zeroes. 16! (or 0x10!) in
 * hexadecimal would be 0x130777758000, which has 3 zeroes.
 * Scalability
 *
 * Unfortunately, machine integer numbers has not enough precision for larger values. Floating point numbers drop the
 * tail we need. We can fall back to arbitrary-precision ones - built-ins or from a library, but calculating the full
 * product isn't an efficient way to find just the tail of a factorial. Calculating 100'000! in compiled language takes
 * around 10 seconds. 1'000'000! would be around 10 minutes, even using efficient Karatsuba algorithm
 * Your task
 *
 * is to write a function, which will find the number of zeroes at the end of (number) factorial in arbitrary
 * radix = base for larger numbers.
 *
 *     base is an integer from 2 to 256
 *     number is an integer from 1 to 1'000'000
 *
 * Note Second argument: number is always declared, passed and displayed as a regular decimal number. If you see a
 * test described as 42! in base 20 it's 4210 not 4220 = 8210.
